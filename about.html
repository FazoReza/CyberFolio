            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Fabian, a 24-year-old cybersecurity learner from a big Mexican household. I’ve always loved tech—from modding Minecraft to building gaming PCs. At 17, I got hacked while gaming, and that experience pushed me toward cybersecurity. Now I’m learning through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and developing skills in Linux, Python, and security fundamentals. I want to stop threats like the one that got me and protect people from what I went through.</p>
